on download finish we need to update torrentsview (this would update on cyclenextview though)
add progress for downloads?
probably need a map for activedownloads not a slice
handle authentiication errors and such
display filename in active downloads not id
should probably add caching. (display cache initially, update when we can without blocking ui)
